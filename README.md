# Front End Task

## Task Description:
Design three interactive boxes â€“ one at the top, another in the middle, and the third at the bottom. Ensure these boxes dynamically expand upon clicking.
Each box, when clicked, should display options for colors and sizes, similar to the functionality observed in the video.

## Requirements:
1. Implementation: The webpage you create should closely match the design in Figma to the best of your ability.
2. HTML: Use basic HTML tags. We're interested in seeing how you structure your HTML and whether you follow basic best practices.
3. CSS: Do not use any CSS frameworks or libraries. Write your own CSS code to style the webpage. Your ability to create responsive designs and use efficient and clean CSS will be under consideration.
4. JavaScript: Use vanilla JavaScript (no libraries or frameworks) to implement the interactive elements.
5. Code Cleanliness and Structuring: Your code should be well-structured and easy to read. Avoid redundancy.
